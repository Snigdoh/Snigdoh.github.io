//If the service worker API is supported in the browser, it is registered against the site using the ServiceWorkerContainer.register() method. Its contents reside in the sw.js file, and can be executed after the registration is successful. It's the only piece of Service Worker code that sits inside the app.js file; everything else that is Service Worker-specific is written in the sw.js file itself.
